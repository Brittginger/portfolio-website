           <h2> The Project </h2>
           <p> I wanted to design a responsive application that allows users an easy and effective
method to access their coverages and specialists and use them to encourage life
habits such a physical training and dietary changes to lead a happier and healthier
lifestyle. At the same time, I did not want to create an app that had so much complexity
that only a few could understand the app
without getting lost </p>
             </div>
           </div>
             <div>
               <div>
            <h2> The problem </h2>
           <p>People need an umbrella app that allows them to choose and stay connected with
their in-network health care professionals while being able to create, store, and view
the progress of their physical and mental goals because they want to start or continue
living a healthier lifestyle easier.  </p>

             <h2> My Role </h2>
                   <p> I actively participated in all roles of this journey including: </p>
                   <ul>
                     <li> Competitive Research & Analysis </li>
                     <li> Wireframe Architecture </li>
                     <li> UX/UI Prototyping </li>
                     <li> Usability Testing & Analysis </li>
                     <li> UI Design </li>
                     <li> Style Guides & Languages </li>
                     <li> Product Presentation </li>
                    </ul>
                 </div>
               </div>
                 <div>
                   <h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
                  <p>My first priority was to review what was currently on the market and
research competitive apps and locate their strengths and weaknesses. I
reviewed customer reviews and complaints and spent time using their
app myself and where my app could dominate.</p>

                  <p>As a customer, I want to be able to access my health insurance when I need it, regardless where I am.</p>

           <h2> Wireframing </h2>
           <p> After my Competitive research and user flows, I developed low fidelity screens for a basic layout that started on paper and was moved online once I settle on a style. </p>

            <h2> User Testing</h2>
            <p>I interviewed 6 volunteers (via Zoom) who answered basic demographic questions.
(with informed consent)They were then asked to interact with the prototypes by
completing certain tasks and providing feedback and frustrations as they went. The
following is are the questions asked and the result.</p>
          </div>
           <div>
             <h3> Resulting Feedback</h3>
             <ul>
               <li> 100% Stated they want an app like Healthful </li>
               <li> 75% Liked that they could schedule appointments for covered family members as well. </li>
               <li> 50% Wanted a more social feel to the app </li>
               <li> 100% Could not immediately locate the insurance information tab. </li>
               <li> 75% Noticed there was no place to cancel or reschedule appointments </li>
             </ul>
           </div>
            <div>
              <h3> The Resulting Alterations </h3>
              <ol>
                <li> I relocated the insurance info and benefits to its own location into the profile page and gave it its own space on the main page for easier access. </li>
                <li> I added an additional section to scheduled appoinments to allow for rescheduling and canceling. <br> * A note will appear during cancellation warning of any possible cancellation fees. </li>
                <li> The main page was reorganized to feel less bare and also give it a social feel by adding in local challenges that anyone in the area can participate in. </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </div>

             <div>
               <h2> Final Prototype </h2>
               <p> After reviewing and altering the wireframes further and receceiving additional feedback from meers and mentors, the current version was created. </p>

                <h3> Final Thoughts and Result</h3>
                <p>From this iteration came several (and I mean SEVERAL)
more after receiving feedback from mentors, peers, and
connections that I have made on my journey. Each change
and alteration brought me closer to Healthful's
current form. It has been a wild ride learning several
software programs while learning through this project, and
I believe due to this experience; I will be able to build and
flourish in the following projects. </p>

                <p>Healthful has plenty of growth that I plan on expanding into.
Mental health is just as important as physical
health and will be implemented as a core feature to
complete the umbrella app that can handle it all. I also
want to work on Healthful's inclusivity to ensure as many
people can use the app as possible. </p>
